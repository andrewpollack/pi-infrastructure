# Pi Infrastructure
Checkins for a raspberry pi setup and k3s cluster I'm playing around with.

## What's hosted?

### [recipe-maker](https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure/tree/main/containers/meals-go)

I got tired of having to pick what to eat for dinner each month, so thus [recipe-maker](https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure/tree/main/containers/meals-go)
was born. [recipe-maker](https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure/tree/main/containers/meals-go) selects and renders a month's worth of recipes, including related grocery list. Comes in two modes:
#### Server deployment:
Deployed on k3s using a Deployment+NodePort Service so I can view this month + next month's meals from my phone or laptop 
(whichever is more convenient at the time). Links are clickable for finding related recipes.

#### Email CronJob:
Deployed on k3s using a CronJob. Every Friday, finds next week's recipes and compiles a grocery list for all items, combining like items by quantity, and assigning each item to its respective aisle. This is then formatted and emailed to me and my partner.

#### Data:
Recipes are stored in a JSON file in a private repository shared with my partner.
This repo has CI/CD setup to validate the contents, and push the JSON file's latest state to S3. This state is then pulled
by the [recipe-maker](https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure/tree/main/containers/meals-go).

While we could just pull from the GitHub
repo itself, CD in this way is far more fun!
