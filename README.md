# Pi Infrastructure
Checkins for a raspberry pi setup and k3s cluster I'm playing around with.

## What's hosted?

### [recipe-maker](https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure/tree/main/containers/meals-go)

I got tired of having to pick what to eat for dinner each month, thus [recipe-maker](https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure/tree/main/containers/meals-go)
was born. [recipe-maker](https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure/tree/main/containers/meals-go) selects and renders a month's worth of recipes, including related grocery list. Comes in two modes:
#### Server deployment:
Deployed on k3s using a Deployment + NodePort Service. This allows viewing this month + next month's meals from my phone, laptop, or tablet by hitting the same URL. Links are clickable for finding related recipes.

#### Email CronJob:
Deployed on k3s using a CronJob. Every Friday, finds next week's recipes and compiles a grocery list for all items, combining like items by quantity, and assigning each item to its respective aisle. This is then formatted and emailed to me and my partner.

#### Data:
Recipes are stored in a JSON file in a private repository shared with my partner.
This repo has CI/CD setup to validate the contents, and push the JSON file's latest state to S3. This state is then pulled
by the [recipe-maker](https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure/tree/main/containers/meals-go).

While we could just pull from the GitHub repo itself, CD in this way is far more fun!

### [garage-go](https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure/tree/main/containers/garage-go)

I (too often) leave for work, round the corner, and immediately second guess whether I closed the garage door. So, I fixed this concern.

This Garage door monitoring system uses a Raspberry Pi 2 W hooked up with a magnetic door sensor. The magnetic door sensor detects when the garage door is in the "closed" position. Metrics are exposed via
a Prometheus exporter, which are scraped by a Prometheus deployment I'm using across these projects. Finally, a dashboard is available to view the yes/no question through Grafana.

*Note: Getting started with the Hardware portion, particularly reading the state of the GPIO pin, was super doable thanks to this book <ins>[Automate Your Home Using Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/gohome/automate-your-home-using-go/)</ins>*
